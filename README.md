# MPPI-Optimality-LCSS2025

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation accompanying the paper:

**Optimality and Suboptimality of MPPI Control in Stochastic and Deterministic Settings**  
by Hannes Homburger, Florian Messerer, Moritz Diehl, and Johannes Reuter  

Accepted for publication in *IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS), 2025*.

Submitted in conjunction with *IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), 2025*.

## 📝 Description

This code reproduces the numerical results and figures presented in the paper, including:

- Evaluation of the optimal MPPI control distribution \( q^*_\beta \)
- Visualization of the convergence behavior of MPPI in both stochastic and deterministic settings
- Analysis of suboptimality and approximation accuracy

The code is written in MATLAB and intended for academic and research purposes.
